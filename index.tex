\section{Introduction}
\noindent
This book is aimed to be a guide for intermediate guitarists looking for a quick reference tool in various situations.
Here are the things I'd like to put there:

\subsection{Notes}
The notes section provides information about the individual notes.
\subsection{Intervals}
Extending that to two notes, we get into relationships between two distinct notes, or intervals
\subsection{Scales \& Modes}
By linking together a few intervals, we achieve a scale. My moving the scale root, we form a mode.
\subsection{Chords}
Chords are a huge topic, mostly because they take a concept of scales and extend it to subsets of them played together.
